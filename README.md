My phone got hacked for my Google accounts got hacked or it could have been my nephew borrowed my phone for a few days I'm just putting out all the things that it can be and I'm trying to get back my old account and Google has sent me recovery links and each time that I do the link or do the two verifications it will not let me go back into my account. I have no clue what's going on I had this happen before like I had a channel on YouTube I had all my information with Google debit cards credit cards personal information and it's starting to freak me out a little bit. Cuz I trusted Google and it's saying that my account has been disabled for some reasons and I don't know what's going on. Now someone has hacked into my Facebook and messenger and I don't have that no more
